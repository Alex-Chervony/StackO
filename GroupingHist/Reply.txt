I'm not sure whether you are looking for a Gantt Chart. If so, your hints by @VinÃ­cius Aguiar, are in the comments.

From your last line 

> I have to find number of users in a specifc hours

It seems you need a histogram showing user amount (freqeuncy) pivoted by hour of day.
If that is the case, you can do something like this:

    #! /usr/bin/python3
    
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    
    # Read the data
    df=pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    
    # Get all hours per user (per observation)
    def sum_hours(obs):
    	return(list(range(obs['hour_s'],obs['hour_e']+1,1)))
    
    # Get all existing activity hours (No matter which user)
    Hours2D=list(df.apply(sum_hours,axis=1))
    # Get all existing hours
    HoursFlat=[hour for sublist in Hours2D for hour in sublist]
    
    # See the list to validate
    # import pprint
    # pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=4)
    # See the 2 dim list, where each row is user's hours, to validate
    # pp.pprint(HoursFlat)
    
    plt.hist(HoursFlat,rwidth=0.5,range=(0,24))
    plt.xticks(np.arange(0,24, 1.0))
    plt.xlabel('Hour of day')
    plt.ylabel('Users')
    plt.show()

Where data.csv is the sample you provided:

    uid, sex,start,end,hour_s,hour_e
    1,0,2000-01-28 16:47:00,2000-01-28 17:47:00,16,17
    2,1,2000-01-28 18:07:00,2000-01-28 21:47:00,18,21
    3,1,2000-01-28 18:47:00,2000-01-28 20:17:00,18,20
    4,0,2000-01-28 08:00:00,2000-01-28 10:00:00,08,10
    5,1,2000-01-28 02:05:00,2000-01-28 02:30:00,02,02
    6,0,2000-01-28 15:10:00,2000-01-28 18:04:00,15,18
    7,0,2000-01-28 01:50:00,2000-01-28 03:00:00,01,03

 You should get the following graph:
