One way is keeping additional metrics for each observation:  
For Bytes_recieved:  
 
 - An indicator of whether the observation is an outlier. This will be
   decided by whether the observed Bytes_recieved are outside of the
   last observed average plus, minus the last observed SD as described
   below.
 - A running average over the last N non outlying events. 
 - Standard deviation over the last N non outlying events. 

N will be based on the amount of observation you want to consider. You mentioned recent days, so  you could set `N = "recent" * average events per day` 

E.g:  
  
	 EMPID date      Bytes_sent  Bytes_recieved  br-avg-last-N  br-sd-last-N  br-Outlier
	 A123  Timestamp 222222      3333333         3333333        2357022.368  FALSE
	 A123  Timestamp 444444      6666666         4999999.5      2356922.368  FALSE
	 A123  Timestamp 99999999    88888888888     N/A            N/A          TRUE

Bytes_recieved Outlier for row three is calculated as whether the observed Bytes_recieved is outside the range defined by:

    (last Bytes_recieved Average-Last-10) - 2*(last Bytes_recieved SD-Last-N) And (last Bytes_recieved Average-Last-10) + 2*(last Bytes_recieved SD-Last-N)
	4999999.5 + 2 * 2356922.368 = 9713844.236; 9,713,844.236 < 88,888,888,888 -> TRUE

2 Standard deviations will give you 96% outliers, i.e. extreme observations you will only see ~4% of the time. You can modify it to your needs.

You can either do the same for Bytes_sent and have an 'Or' condition for the outlier decision, or calculate distance from a multi dimensional running average (here X is Bytes_sent and Y is Bytes_recieved) and mark outliers based on extreme distances. (You'll need to track a running SD or another spread metric per observation)   
This way you could also easily add dimensions: time of day anomalies, extreme differences between Bytes_sent and Bytes_recieved etc.
