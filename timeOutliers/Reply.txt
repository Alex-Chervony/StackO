If I understand correctly, you are looking to identify people who depart extremely early or arrive extremely late compared to their own and overall norms.

 1. The first issue you encountered seems related to tagging outliers that deviate by Z x (standard deviation) late or early. You usually have control whether the outliers are on one both sides
 2. The second issue has to do with mean being biased or unstable with a small sample.
    Unless you know the outlier thresholds ahead of time, you will need a healthy sample to identify outliers in any case. If mean does not zero in quick enough to the common, and
    you seek the common value, use Mode instead of mean.

Also, I would suggest looking at the daily hours - difference between arrival and departure each day as a separate metric.

Below I have a directional approach / suggestion to tackle your problem, python3 (sorry).   
It should address the issues you mentioned but does not add the daily hours I think you should include. 

This is the output you can expect:

	Outlier PersonIDs based on overall data
	array([ 1.,  4.,  7.,  8.])
	Outlier PersonIDs based on each user's data and overall deviation
	array([ 1.,  3.,  4.,  5.,  7.,  8.,  9.])
	
This is the daily arrival and departure time distributions:
